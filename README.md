# Gold Price Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  

This project implements a **Gold Price Prediction** model using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. Gold prices are influenced by various economic factors like currency exchange rates, inflation, and geopolitical events. This model leverages historical data and financial indicators to accurately predict future gold prices.  

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and preparation for model training.  
- **ANN Model**: A multi-layer neural network designed to identify patterns in data and make predictions.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Uses Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.  
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to analyze trends and assess predictions.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: For scripting and model implementation.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train the ANN.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.  

## Installation and Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
